# Maximizing ROI per Genre or How to Make Money in Film

It's 2020. You've decided to get into the film market. Perhaps your capital financiers and investors are tone deaf to the current environment, leaving you stuck to the original, pre-COVID19 funding agreement. Perhaps you're independently wealthy and now that filming restrictions have eased up ([Film and TV Projects Resume Filming](https://www.nme.com/news/film/tv-and-film-projects-batman-recommence-filming-uk-coronavirus-2679830)), you can finally make that dream project happen.

Or, perhaps, you represent Microsoft and tired of the Bill Gates microchip rumors ([Bill Gates Vaccine Rumor](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-spurns-conspiracy-wants-vaccine-to-give-people-microchips-2020-7)), you've decided to start a film studio to generate some goodwill and profit.

Whatever the reason, you've decided to open a film studio.

Due to uncertainties in the current market, you've decided to **analyze ROI (return on investment) and genre to maximize your investment and cushion your entrance into this highly competitive field.**

## Project Requirements and Process

Having no experience in the film industry, it's best to make money by analyzing how other studios have made money. Simple. As such, this project's findings are based off publicly available production budgets, domestic and foreign gross totals, and agreed genre classifications across multiple sources.

To ensure accuracy and eliminate missing data, we gathered information from:

[The Numbers: Budget and Gross](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets)

[Box Office Mojo: Gross and Genre](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross_adjusted/?adjust_gross_to=2020&ref_=bo_cso_ac)

[IMBD: Popular Movies](https://www.imdb.com/chart/moviemeter?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=f64ddce8-e7c9-426a-a97f-375b1c7263f2&pf_rd_r=RPYP1M5Q4HVKDH3E1H4S&pf_rd_s=right-2&pf_rd_t=15051&pf_rd_i=genre&ref_=ft_gnr_mvch_1)

Furthermore, sticking to recent trends, we only analyzed films from the past ten years, from 2010-2019.

## Down to Business: Taking a Look at the Data

Eliminating clutter and increasing visibility, we start with an initial, aerial view of the market.

Looking at profit margins across markets, we start to notice our first trends.

![Gross ROI Genre](/assets/Gross%20ROI%20Genre.png)

Across both domestic and international markets, a small number of genres show a consistent high rate of return: drama, mystery, horror, and romance.

Reorienting the visualization of genre/ROI, we see our initial findings confirmed. However, this still doesn't provide a look at performance over time.

## A Closer Look

Aside from a few larger budget films, we can clearly see a high concentration of low budget productions with a high ROI.

Our suspected high return genres (Drama, Mystery, Horror, Romance) show a consistent ROI over 400%. Moreover, in the last three years, these genres have become more profitable.

## Conclusions

**In summation, the most lucrative approach to filmmaking necessitates a low budget, an understanding of global markets and an adherence to market trends.**


### Further Research

Sorting through our data, we also found a consistently high worldwide gross for Action and Adventure films.

While there is further research to be done on the proliferation and profitability of Action/Adventure tentpole films (e.g., comic book movies, franchises, etc.), there is sufficient and compelling evidence these genres may be worth their production budget. Just ask Marvel.
